## — OVERVIEW

Our challenge was to design a work environment concept so attractive that employees of all generations, functions and working styles love to come to the office of Würth. Along our journey though we found out designing an attractive work environment is **by no means constrained to the physical space, but needs to be a hybrid solution.**

Some teams of Würth Elektronik work **scattered across countries and locations - even before the pandemic**. However, during the pandemic remote work has been the new normal for everybody.

In the digital space a lot of the emotions, thoughts and awareness get lost, thus overall the need for teams to address their individual well-being and enhance their team spirit has increased.

When working in the office, employees stated a lack of confidentiality as well as privacy, partly due to not having enough ways to communicate boundaries clearly.

In order to tackle these two challenges and create an inviting environment, that supports hybrid working routines, we came up with two solutions that compliment each other:

- **The Capsule Modules** offer flexible spaces for several work modes by accommodating focused, collaborative, alone and team work routines whilst guaranteeing confidentiality.
  
- **The Happy Tracker** records and transparently shares individual and team wellbeing within the team. It allows employees to feel connected with each other when working remotely.

## — RESEARCH AND FINDINGS

### Creating a common understanding

We started off by conducting desktop research and explored the different dimensions of the challenge. We soon realized that aspects like information flow, trust, belonging, open communication are chore aspects to our challenge, that have to be considered from the beginning.

### Building Empathy By Listening

We conducted **about 30 interviews** including team leaders and team members. We realized Würth is a company that has people from a diverse background of age, nationalities, and profession or role. Important findings include:

- Working from home the communication with team colleagues is weaker and there is an overload in screen time.

- However, for most of the interviewees it is easier to get individual tasks done.
  
- There was an overall interest in having hybrid working solutions in the future and a need to keep the flexibility gained throughout the remote work.

We decided to **observe our behaviours** as well to deepend the understanding for Würth's employees, since we all happened to have been either working or studying from home by the time.

We also conducted **observations** for which 2 team members went to a coworking space in Berlin to observe the work situation.

After synthetizing our findings we agreed on the main key insights:

## — SENSE MAKING AND SYNTHESIS

### Identifying flexibility as the main driver

The diversity of the interviews ranging from working students, to the heads of department allowed us a wide perception of the employees needs. We identified one emerging theme: **Flexibility.**

- Working from home allows employees to create and **manage their work tasks independently**.
  
- Managing work tasks alongside private responsibilities which means **integrating the work life into their private life and not the other way around.**
  
- Limited choice of office work space that allows for individual focus work as well as collaboration spaces that are not standard meeting rooms.  
  
This gained flexibility however, was for some translated in wanting to work more to prove and "keep" the given flexibility.

### Points of view to deepend the understanding

We chose two points of view based on real quotes of the interviewees to keep working from:

### Choosing hybrid solutions: Combining physical and virtual spaces

It was important for our team to find solutions that are applicable for the physical and virtual context as most of the employees suggested a strong preference for hybrid solutions.

With this as a starting point we conducted an ideation workshop, were we generated more than 200 ideas and thoughts. We then clustered them to make more sense of them.

After discussing different ideas we voted for the ones we feel very strongly about to make a first selection of possible solution opportunities.

### Narrowing it down

Based on our top rankings, we chose ideas and used the framework of the idea dashboard to flesh out and deepen the ideas.

![ideadashboard](/images/wuerth/w_ideadashboard.png) horizontal

The idea dashboard helps us to better communicate what the solution is about, how it solves Madinis and Meghas problems and how it can be used.

We created about six idea dashboards and continued with two of them for the prototype and testing phase: **The Happy Tracker and the Capsule Modules.**

## — THE IDEAS

### The Capsules

 It consists of a small space that’s sound isolated and closed and it serves different use cases, however the user can decide for which task / use case they use it. Each of these Capsules are bookable online by any employee that needs them.

![capsuleconcept](/images/wuerth/capsuleconcept.jpg)

#### Focus Capsule

You’ve been working from home for the last year. You are most likely having mixed feelings about going to the physical office again; on one side you want to see your colleagues, have lunch with them, but you know how loud and non private it is; the phone ringing, people talking...

![scenario1](/images/wuerth/scenario1.png)

But what if I tell you that you can easily book a focused capsule to get your work done without getting interrupted at the office, and at the same time you’re gonna be able to see your colleagues, have lunch with them and exchange thoughts.

#### Lounge Capsule

You're a manager at Würth and realize that during the week there was apparently a heavy workload for your team members.

![scenario2](/images/wuerth/scenario2.png)

The days of uncomfortable and sterile meeting rooms are finally over. The sofas and homey atmosphere make it easier to address difficult topics and build better connections with colleagues.

#### Co-creation Capsule

In this scenario you’re working with your team on a project. You seem somehow to be a little stuck and going in circles, you need the proper environment to let new ideas flow and create solutions together with your team.

![scenario3](/images/wuerth/scenario3.png)

You and your team arrange a date and time, book the capsule and create new solutions in an inviting, yet agile and fast moving environment.

### The Happy Tracker

#### Overview

- Tracking own wellbeing on a daily basis through an app
- Submitting results on a weekly basis
- Collecting data of the team in an anonymous way
- Transparently seeing how many team members have already submitted their data, which motivates the user to do the same and grows team spirit.

#### The Happy Tracker major impact points

For the employee it will make it easier over time to **reflect on how they feel** and thus collaborating towards a healthy workspace with ideas, behaviors, etc. One potential gain is them **actively voicing their needs**, which is an important basis for a healthy work environment.

The entire team is aware of their individual wellbeing including the team manager, across locations and time. It becomes easier to **assess the team's wellbeing and where change is needed.**

The possibility to provide individual anonymized (or not) comments makes it possible to go into further detail about the “why” of feeling a certain way, everybody can then actively trigger discussions in team sessions.

The Happy Tracker is a tool designed for hybrid work environments and does not replace human interaction.

#### User Flow

### Prototyping and testing

For the Happy Tracker we made a digital prototype in Figma, and the Capsule Modules one using the cardboard prototyping. During this process, we further improved our ideas, added features, and in general made our ideas more tangible and graspable.

After iterating on our ptototypes we decided to test them with the users. Since it was online, we had to be creative. We translated the physical cardboard prototype into a digital one.

For the Happy Tracker we realized, at this point of the design, we needed to test **the concept** instead of the **usability** of the app.

That's why we quickly had to find other alternatives to test other than the Figma prototype. We had to think about how to test the idea, so we came up with the following:

1. Contacted our interview partners and asked if they would like to participate in our testing
2. Created a survey for each participant which would be the Happy Tracker, where we asked questions about their wellbeing and teamspirit during the week.
3. Asked each participant to fill their correspondant form every day for a week.
4. At the end of the week scheduled a 20 minute call with each participant, where we tried to find out:
   - If they could imagine filling that out at the end of every week
   - If they would do it voluntarily or only if it was a rule
   - How much time they invested answering those questions
   - If they see any personal and team value in doing this at the end of the week
   - if they think it could improve the team spirit

"When you are with people phsyically, you can read their body language and without talking you can have an idea how that person is doing. However working from home this becomes more of a challenge, since you can't really know how the other person is feeling"

We found out most participants won't use the Happy Tracker voluntarily, as they would probably forget about it. However if it would be implemented as part of the work time and as a reflection tool in their team, they would be happy to use it.

Most participants said they think it is valuable both personally and for the team to use the Happy Tracker.

"I think this would be a valuable tool not only for teams that work from home or hybrid, but for all teams"

### Learnings

This project was meaningful for me because I got to know the design thinking process in a deep way. The coaches and instructors of the course were supportive and helpful at all times which made this experience really unique and important.

Working together with Würth's employees was also an enriching experience. For this project it was also crusial to understand the office space as a whole and not only the physical space in order to fulfill the employees' needs.

    overview_text: Our challenge was to design a work environment concept so attractive that employees of all generations, functions and working styles love to come to the office of a manufacturer for the electronics industry. Along our journey we found out designing an attractive work environment is **by no means constrained to the physical space, but needs to be a hybrid solution.** Why?(-) Some teams of Würth Elektronik work **scattered across countries and locations - even before the pandemic**. However, during the pandemic remote work has been the new normal for everybody. In the digital space a lot of the emotions, thoughts and awareness get lost, thus overall the need for teams to address their individual well-being and enhance their team spirit has increased. - When working in the office, employees stated a lack of confidentiality as well as privacy, partly due to not having enough ways to communicate boundaries clearly. In order to tackle these two challenges and really create an inviting environment, that supports hybrid working routines, we have come up with two solutions that compliment each other - **The Capsule Modules** offer flexible spaces for several work modes by accommodating focused, collaborative, alone and team work routines whilst guaranteeing confidentiality **The Happy Tracker** records and transparently shares individual and team wellbeing within the team. It allows employees to feel connected with each other when working remotely.

## — RESEARCH AND FINDINGS 

### Gathering information and sharing experiences: creating a common understanding

We started off by conducting desktop research but also casually talked to other people we knew about it and shared our own experiences with each other. Together, we explored different dimensions and viewpoints of the challenge.  When we shared our findings,  different pictures of showcase examples were shown, we realized there is a lot of options and tools out there to make the office space more attractive, and also to adapt office buildings to diverging needs of its users. We also soon realized as well that aspects like information flow, trust, belonging, open communication are chore aspects to our challenge, that have to be considered from the beginning. Scholary articles like "Creating the Best Workplace on Earth" helped us understand this better.


### Building empathy by listening to them 

Together we conducted about 30 interviews including its team leaders and team members. We realized Würth is a company that has people from a diverse background of age, nationalities, and profession or role. And we of course needed to have this present from the beginning. We found out that working from home the communication with team colleagues is weaker and there is an overload in screen time. However, for most of the interviewees it is easier to get individual tasks done quicker. There was an overall interest in having hybrid working solutions in the future and a need to keep the flexibility gained throughout the remote work. We decided to observe ourselves to deepend the understanding with the users. We all happened to have been either working or studying from home by the time as well, so each of us observed ourselves for a day and wrote down our feelings; what we liked about the home office and what we missed.
We also conducted observations for which 2 team members went to a coworking space in Berlin to observe the work situation. They found out that many people had a big problem working in a noisy atmosphere, what we also realized during the interviews and from our own experiences. 

It is always a challenge to synthetize the most important insights of the research phase. Specially knowing how our decisions could potentially infulence the lives of so many. However after a lot of effort we put together the key insights of the interviews and observations that helped us furhter develop:

## — SENSE MAKING AND SYNTHESIS 
### Identifying flexibility as the main driver 
Thanks to diversity of the interviews ranging from working students, to the heads of department we were able to have a wide perception of the employees needs. We identified one emerging theme that has been addressed throughout the interviews: Flexibility. This means: 
- Working from home allows them to create and manage their work tasks independently. 
- Managing your work tasks alongside your private responsibilities which means integrating the work life into their private life and not the other way around. 
- Limited choice and inadequate work space that allows for individual focus work as well as collaboration spaces that are not standard meeting rooms.  
This gained flexibility however, was for some translated in wanting to work more to prove and "keep" the given flexibility

### Points of view, to deepend the understanding:

We created two personas two increase the empathy and understanding at this point, and also to solidify the points of view from which we were going to keep going: 

Hi, I’m Madini and I have been working for Würth for the last two years. I just turned 29 years old and I would describe myself as an outgoing and fun person. I really love my job and I have a great relationship with my colleagues who I consider somehow also my ‘work friends`. Since Corona hit and we all moved to the home office, I have the feeling of not being able to set clear boundaries between my work and private life. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy the flexibility of doing my laundry during the lunch break or taking a longer break whenever I don’t have calls. But I noticed also, that I work way longer hours late into the evening and I just can’t turn my laptop off. Honestly, I get nervous when I see my availability sign on outlook moves from green to absent. I just feel the pressure to prove myself to the manager and to demonstrate how well I can work remotely. I don’t want to give up on this newly won freedom of managing my day and tasks the way it works best for me. But I really don’t care if my colleagues work fewer hours than me and I noticed that we speak way less to each other. Just picking up the phone and calling them in the home office for no reason feels wrong and I don’t want to bother them. However, I really miss our coffee chats and lunch breaks together. 


Hi, I’m Megha, 32 years old and I've been working as a Partnership Manager at Würth for the last 2,5 years. For the work I’m doing, namely building  relationships and creating new partnerships I need an impressive, yet inviting and confidentiality providing office environment and atmosphere. It is an important part of my job to create meaningful connections with external partners and colleagues and discuss tough topics while ensuring privacy. 
Our current meeting rooms are alright, but honestly they could be way prettier, and more inviting when you enter. It’s sometimes frustrating that I can’t showcast  how great our company is and what we are capable of doing by just stepping into an impressive meeting room. Even though the rooms are well equipped with technical tools they are not impressive or unique. 
I’d love to be able to invite partners and also have chats with my colleagues in a hotel lounge similar environment in order to create a more inviting and authentic experience. Being able to sit on a sofa, armchair or other furniture while drinking a coffee and chatting with guests and colleagues would create a more relaxed situation and increase trust. Especially the privacy part makes me sometimes uncomfortable. While telephone boxes currently exist in the office, I’m not happy with them because they are not sound isolated and they make it impossible to have confidential discussions without being heard by others. 


### Choosing hybrid solutions to combine the physical and virtual space 
It was important for our team to find solutions that are applicable for the physical and virtual context as most of the employees suggested a strong preference for hybrid solutions. With this as a starting point we conducted an ideation workshop, were we generated more than 200 ideas and thoughts. We then clustered them to make more sense of them. 

After discussing different ideas we voted for the ones we feel very strongly about to make a first selection of possible solution opportunities. The picture below shows the ideas that received the highest scores and the ones that the team was most passionate about. In order to generate thoughtful and good solutions, we have to be excited and passionate about the ideas. Only then, we are able to unlock our creativity and the team's full potential, especially when the process feels stagnant or not moving forward. 

### Narrowing it down 

Based on our top rankings, we chose ideas and used the framework of the idea dashboard to flesh out and deepen the ideas.

The idea dashboard helps us to better communicate what the solution is about, how it solves Madinis and Meghas problems and how it can be used. 

We created about six idea dashboards and continued with two of them for the prototype and testing phase: The Happy Tracker and the Capsule Modules.

### Prototyping and testing

After having clarity on which ideas we were going to further pursue, we create prototypes for the two ideas. The Happy Tracker as a digital prototype in Figma, and the Capsule Modules as a physical one using the cardboard prototyping. During this process, we further improved our ideas, added features, and in general made our ideas more tangible and graspable. We let go of some things, added new ones. 

After iterating on our ptototypes we decided to test them with the users. Since it was online, we had to be creative. We translated the physical cardboard prototype into a digital one. 

For the Happy Tracker we realized that at that point, we needed to test **the concept** instead of the **usability** of the app. That's why we quickly had to find other alternatives to test other than the Figma prototype. We had to think about how to test the idea, so we did the following: 

1. Contacted our interview partners and asked if they would like to participate in our testing 
2. Created a survey for each participant which would be the Happy Tracker. The survey looked like this: ![testsurvey](/images/w_survey.png) vertical
3. Asked each participant to fill their correspondant form every day for a week. 
4. At the end of the week scheduled a 20 minute call with each participant, where we tried to find out: 
   - If they could imagine filling that out at the end of every week 
   - If they would do it voluntarily or only if it was a rule
   - How much time they invested answering those questions
   - If they see any personal and team value in doing this at the end of the week
   - if they think it could improve the team spirit 

"When you are with people phsyically, you can read their body language and without talking you can have an idea how that person is doing. However working from home this becomes more of a challenge, since you can't really know how the other person is feeling"

We found out most participants won't use the Happy Tracker voluntarily, as they would probably forget about it. However if it would be implemented as part of the work time and as a reflection tool in their team, they would be happy to use it. Most participants said they think it is valuable both personally and for the team to use the Happy Tracker. 

"I think this would be a valuable tool not only for teams that work from home or hybrid, but for all teams"

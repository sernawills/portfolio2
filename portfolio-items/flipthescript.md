## PROCESS
### Context 

During my TechLabs journey, I was meant to choose a project to work on with a team. A lot of the projects were quite interesting. However I decided to work on this one: Flip The Script. When I heard about it I knew almost instantly I wanted to choose it because it was a topic I resonated with. As an UX designer I am passionate about people, and in finding creative ways to fulfill the user needs, but at the same time creating a bigger impact.

The Problem:
The main problem we are solving for them is the lack of non-gender biased resources in the internet. Other problems or pain points include not having an educational yet engaging and easy to understand platform where to find more information about gender and why language is so important. Flip The Scrip was the best option for me, since is an application aimed to relieve yet not totally solve a deep problem we have as a society in the way we perceive gender.

The Solution:
Offering the user through an application the option to input a text, and get a non-biased version of it. Being also an educational platform, where users can find more information on this topic and why it is important, statistics on how gender biased online resources are, and a predictor for articles, to know how likely it is for an article to be gender biased.

The Team:
My role in the team was the UX designer. I did the research of the target group, the research of their needs, build personas, build requirements, etc. Always in hand with my team composed of 3 developers: one data scientist, one back end developer and one front end developer.

### Building Empathy 

Survey Findings 
Thanks to the survey I could gather important insights about my target audience and their needs. The questions I asked were based on my research on the topic: readings, videos, academical papers, etc. The survey helped me later to improve my personas and create new scenarios. So I can say the user research phase was an iterative process.

Personas 
I started creating personas even before the results of the surveys and interviews, but later on I improved and change them based on the findings. I created three personas; Alex, Louisa, and Jeff. I referred to them during the process. I realized creating personas is a powerful tool, it allowed me to empathize better, stimulate my creativity, and think outside of the box. It makes me remember that I am designing for real people, with real needs and wishes.

With help of the personas I also created scenarios. Same as with the personas, I created them at first to help me articulate the questions of the survey and interview. And after the findings, I created new scenarios. I can say, the user research phase was definitely an iterative process.

### Creating requirements and strategy.
In the strategy board I stated all different possible requirements, based on the user research, and organized it by what is the most important for the user, and what is feasible for my team bearing in mind constraints like time, money, and skills. Based on that board, I build the requirements for our application.

As we see although the web extension had the highest importance for our user, the feasibility was really low. That's how we decided to implement the option to input text and get a gender translation, the information about the relevance of the pronouns, statistics, and a social media share button. Unfortunately due to time pressure that last one is still under construction.

Knowing which requirements we have and also what's the most and least important for the user and what Flip The Script's goal is, I started thinking about the information architecture.

### Information Architecture
After having clear the requirements, I started thinking about how to organize the information and how to create appropriate paths for the user. Based on the information gathered during the user research phase, and on Flip The Script's goals, I started to prioritize. For example I found out that the pronoun convertor is of big importance for the user, as well as for us. Therefore this is our main feature and it needed to be present in a way that caught the attention of the user, and give them a call to action, at all times.

During the process, I asked myself the following guiding questions inspired by the Udemy course:

What is the visitor most interested in?

What is the most important/relevant of the project and also for the participants of the survey?

ANSWER: The flipping the pronouns of the texts.

What would the content be?

ANSWER: The flipping feature (translator), the statistics, information about why this is important, and about us.

How long is it?

How and where can it be presented?

ANSWER: Progressive disclosure. So start with the z layout, in the home page you have as little information as possible that allows you to take the action that the user is most interested in: so the flipping feature.

How do you structure it?

For this answer I tried doing a decision path diagram, the one on the left.

### Making UI Decisions
I usually start the UI design process with fast prototypes, so extremely low fidelity, and I did them with paper. I didn't use a pencil to not be tempted to erase anything, and just work on as many as I could.

I started doing sketches after I defined the requirements and created an information architecture plan, as well as user paths. As I mentioned, prioritizing information is a big part of this phase, that's why during this phase I already took some decisions:

I decided to use a slightly modified Z Layout for the landing page, calling the user to action (in this case to our convertor, which is an essential feature for the user and for us)

There's in total two call to action in the landing page, one in the top right corner, and one in the center of the page.

I knew before the call to action, we needed to add some convincing and persuadable text first.

The order of the menu items needed to be based on the priority features have for the user, so the ones that didn't have a big importance for the user were placed in the middle of the menu bar, since elements in the middle don't get as much attention.

The design for the convertor needed to be simple, yet functional. The user needed to be able to use it fast, yet know that it is possible to have more options. At the beginning I wanted to use progressive disclosure and let the user answer some questions first. However, in this case is unnecessary since the user is already familiarized with the structure and function of an online translator like Google Translate or Deepl. That's why less information is best. At the same time, at the end we took the decision to make the predictor a separate feature, to avoid clutter of information for the user, and allow them to use our product in a comfortable and intuitive way. The final design has a "default" option (flip the pronouns to opposite gender) for the user to just start using it right away, and in case they want to change it to neutral pronouns they can always do. So no thinking, just using.

### Wireframes
After doing some sketches, and I made some decisions about how I wanted to place the information, I started working on low fidelity prototypes with Figma. This was useful to organize a bit better my thoughts and solidify my decisions until then. I did only one iteration but I worked on it for a long time and changed some stuff. Next time I will probably do multiple iterations, and decide for one later. This was useful to identify better the user paths, and layout.

### Logo
Of course creating the logo was a big and important part of this project. I knew the logo needed to represent gender, including female and male but also non binary. It was a big challenge. I needed to express gender in a non binary way, for humans that have been influenced during centuries and have unconscious bias about gender, and specially having a concept of non binary gender that not completely solid, as opposed to the one of female and male genders. I needed to represent it in a way that is still familiar, recognizable and comfortable to the potential visitor and user of our application, but that at the same time make them feel like something is different and intriguing. I looked for inspiration. I draw, played with my thoughts, and kept drawing. My strategy was quick drawings, not much detail, simple, not much time to think. After many iterations I chose 10 that I later draw again in Figma. I asked my team to vote for their favorite. And that's how we chose our logo.

The circular part I knew the logo needed to have represents fluidity. The final logo then means flexibility, yet inspires trust, and gives a sense of security, of being safe. It has an abstraction of the gender symbols, which make it recognizable, yet different and intriguing due to its fluty.

### UI Design
I decided for a fresh, modern yet friendly design since I realized during the research process, that I am designing mainly for young people. At the beginning I wanted to go for a dark style, however I ended up choosing more of a light and modern one because I realized, it represents Flip The Script the best. Also Flip The Script is all about change, about flipping and questioning, educating. That's why the style had to match the brand's purpose, roots, and vision.

I designed for desktop, and partly for mobile.

I am proud for designing the graphics (statistics), since it was a challenging, specially the layout of them. I also like that I created our own style, with the multiple objects like the bubbles and black square, by trying new things out and orienting me every time with the personas and our goals as Flip The Script.

Our application changes colors every time the user ends up in a new page. This color changing means change, fluty. Yet the design elements like the bubbles, the black square, the buttons, the logo, and the typeface are consistent, giving this feeling of trust and familiarity to the user. This is just another example on how the whole design reflects our goals and vision as Flip The Script, and is comfortable, intriguing and easy to use for the user.

### Challenges & Learnings
Communication is more important than we actually think it is.

Although the design process can get messy, finding organization in the disorganization is key for success.

Testing is important.

Iteration is an incredible tool. Don't get in love with any idea or design.

Knowing which questions to ask isn't as easy as it seems.

Most of the user decisions are influenced by a lot of factors we wouldn't think they would. Being good at this means being aware of those little details.

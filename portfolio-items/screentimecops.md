### Research Findings & Target Group

We started off by doing some desktop research, gathering information about the topic. We realized it is a wide problem that affects a wide array of people. Thats why we decided to focus on teenagers. The major insights we got from our research were: 
- Addiction to the internet can cause anger especially in male teenagers 
- As any other addiction, it was found that teenagers with unstable households are more prone to develop internet addiction 
- Teenagers that spend more time in social media (especially female) tend to have self esteem issues, eating disorders, and depression compared to their peers that don't

We found that last point interesting, and that's why we decied to narrow our target group even more: female teenagers in the age of 13 to 17.
Conducted a survey where we asked 37 female teenagers the following questions: 

1. How old are you? 
2. Which is your favorite online platform? 
3. What do you do in there?
4. How many hours do you think you spend on your phone? 
5. What do you do when you are online? 
6. Why do you go online? 
7. Do you feel sad for no reason sometimes? 
8. In a scale from 0 to 10, how confident are you?

What we found was interesting, and also worrying. We realized that between the participants of the survey, there is a corelation between time online, self esteem, and feelings of sadness. We also found out: 
- Most participants spend between 4 to 7 hours a day on their phone 
- The most voted favorite app is TikTok
- Interacting with friends, inspiration, and boredom under the most chosen reasons to go online and to their favorite app
- Around 57% experience unexplainable feelings of sadness, and 16.2% doesn't know if they do

After analysing the results of the survey, we decided to focus on those three reasons as a core of our further development: interaction, inspiration and boredom. 

### Cultural Probes

The next step was to design cultural probes. We used this method as a way to get closer, build empathy and immerse into the life of our target group. And also as a way to gain inspiration. After a few iteration rounds, the help from our professor, coach, and fellow participants of the course, we created the following cultural probes structure: 

During a three day period, participants will have a bundle of activities to do each day. Some activities were going to be done every day, and some were a one time activity. 

Everyday Activities: 
- **How many hours did you spend on your phone?** The participants were asked every day to write in big numbers, how many hours they spent on their phone. This was intended to be both useful for us, but also as a reflection tool for the participants.
- **How do you feel?**: Using alternative modes to the conventional diry like using songs, textures, colors and drawings, participants should document how they felt every day. This was aimed to help us find out a deeper co-relation between hours spent in the phone and mood. 
- **How do you feel? - Deeper**: With help of a diagram the participants should rate their mood hourly. 
- **Daily hashtags**: Using hashtags to describe their day, gave us a glanze at what their normal day looks like using keywords.
- **What inspires you?**: Reflecting every day on what you saw online and choosing one video, post, etc. to reflect on. What was it? where did you see it? why did you like it? The participants were asked to answer this questions with a drawing or other artistic expression and/or text
- **Instagram stories**: We set up an Instagram account which the participants should follow. Each day we posted a challenge, a little question or reflection that the participants should answer/react to. This was indended to serve as a way to create a bridge between them and us. 

One Time Activities: 
- **How does a normal day look like?**: Using a circle with all the hours of the day, they should write down the activities that they normally do on a standard day. With help of the stickers they also rate each activity as good/fun, or bad/boring.
- **How does an ideal day look like?**: Using the same tecnique they were asked to design their ideal day. 
- **How do you see yourself in 10 years?**: Where do you live? work? who is with you? what do you do for fun? what does the world look like? All those questions accompained by a voluntary drawing of their future were answered by the participants.
- **What are your favorite accounts?**: Using a pedestral image the participants should put their three favorite accounts, accompained by their platform and a reason why they liked those accounts. 

After some iterations on the design of the cultural probes, we decided to work with the colors of TikTok, to create a familiar feeling with the participants. The cultural probes were given with a tote bag, some markers and a crafty kit to complete all the exercises. 

### Getting Participants 

When we were done with the cultural probes we realized that finding participants was imposing a bigger challenge than we thought. A lot of people participated in a 3 minute survey, but finding participants of the target group for the cultural probes was no easy task. In fact after talking to our coach, other participants and asking each of our personal circles, we couldn't find any participant of the target group. Was also bad timing since at the time the restrictions surrounding the corona pandemic were in surge and so did the numbers of infections. We however decided to keep our cultural probes physical. After talking to our professor and coach we decided to do a swift in our target group and allow older women in their twenties to be part of the process, since it was a target group we had easier access to at that time. We manage to give the cultural probes to 5 women in their twenties. 

### Insights of Cultural Probes 

After gathering the material back from our participants and a positive feedback about the exercises and reflections, we met to gather the most important insights we found: 
- Most participants spent at least 4 hours daily on their phone, some days going to up to 7 hours
- In some cases when there was a stressful situation, was compensated with the usage of the phone. Which is interesting because I believe this might be a significant difference between the target groups, teenagers using the internet for boredom vs women to tackle stress 
- They all value the social media platforms as a way to communicate, and share with friends 

Overall this helped us get closer to the potential users, understand their lives a little bit better, their motivations, etc. 

### Ideation Workshop 

At this point we had some ideas on which service we wanted to prototype at the end of the class. To further explore this and other ideas we organized an ideation workshop. For this again we struggled to find participants, especially since the duration of the workshop was supposed to be three hours. After some days the professor suggested us to try a shorter format and to experiment with the structure, so we did. We decided to go for a 30 minute format with all the participants, where we would explore ideas further, and rate those. After that we would as a team continue to further develop those ideas into fast prototypes and the participants that wanted to stay for another half an hour were welcome to stay. We did it like this and it was succesful. After the half an hour one participant decided to stay (out of two) and this was incredible helpful. The workshop was conceptualized as follow: 

**Part 1**
1. Introduction of the topic and of each participant by saying: 
   - Name 
   - Occupation
   - Favorite App
2. HMW (How might we?) Questions: We introduced a set of questions that we previously prepared to frame the workshop and give the participants an idea on what was intended. 
3. Ideation/brainstorming session for 15 minutes
4. Explanation round of each idea 
5. Rating of the ideas 
6. Choosing the most voted ideas to further develop

**Part 2**

1. Introduction of the concept of idea napkin 
2. Each participant chooses one of the two ideas 
3. 15 minute silent prototyping with drawing, text, role play
4. Exchange of each prototype 
   

After the first half of the workshop we gathered a lot of ideas from all of us 5 participants in total.

At the end of the ideation/prototyping workshop we had a much clearer direction, two ideas to choose from and four prototypes. We met the next day to discuss the direction we wanted to take. We decided to go for the idea "Screentime Cops". 

### Screentime Cops: Digital Solution For Internet Addiction?

Screentime Cops is conceptualized as a social media application, where the user gives their friends certain control and data over their online behaviour, in order to decrease the time spent online. The social interaction component should be at the core, since we realized early on in the process, that it is a key component. The following shows how Screentime Cops helps the user reduce their online time: 

### Learnings 

This process was fun, especially the ideation workshop. There was times where we as a group felt lost in the process, and also hopeless during challenges like finding the participants. However we larnt that no every project will go perfect and smooth but quite the opposite and knowing how to overcome those challenges is key. Also learning how to let go of an idea, reframe the problem and be flexible is key to success in every design challenge.

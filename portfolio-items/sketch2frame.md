## — THE CHALLENGE

### Why Sketch2Frame?

After brainstorming for ideas and problems to tackle the challenge, we realized we find AI tools interesting and wanted to challenge the idea of "AI is going to replace designers" and stand more to: "AI can empower designers". We decided on this idea, because we found ourselves starting paper wireframes which are incredible useful and won't want to skip that step, and then having to transfer those into Figma frames. That step seemed to be a bit tedious and not that fun sometimes. So we came up with the idea of an AI and AR (Augmented Reality) tool that scans paper wireframes and exports them into Figma frames.

## — THE PROCESS

### Just do it

We had three weeks time to deliver a finished UI, we knew the focus for this project is in the UI design. We started off by picking the theme. We went for a darkmode themed App because we both like it, and thought also would be a good match for the user group. The colors were chosen by reviewing the Material Design Guidelines for dark mode and picking some suggestions. We wanted a modern yet trustable and stable typeface for our app, that was fresh, simple, slightly playful yet grounded and that's why we decided to go for Poppins. However after the first round of feedback we were pointed out that we should use a more neutral font for the buttons, since this improves readability and is also conventional. So we picked Open Sans for the buttons. Poppins for the title, headings, screen headers, and body text.

### Core Features: Prioritizing

We started to decide which screens we needed to design first in order to have an MVP by the middle of the first week. We decided the following are the most important:

- Login screens
- Main function: camera view where the user takes the picture of the paper wireframes
- Home or screen where the user is going to see the saved files
- Edit screen where the user can edit the files

### First round of feedback: Userflow

After the first round of feedback, we started working on the onboarding. This was necessary to introduce the user to the app, since is not a conventional app, so the user needs some sort of short guiding in order to use the app. Up until now, after the login screen the user came immediately to the action page were they take the picture. However, this was also pointed out during the feedback. We realized that although we created an user flow to help us better structure the arquitecture of the app from the beginning, there were some spots were it wasn't completely clear how the user gets from one screen to the next. So we decided to improve this which lead us to change the screen right after the onboarding to be the home screen, rather than the take photo screen.

We also updated our userflow which at the end looked like this:

Other feedback we got was if it is necessary to have a sign up and login screens at all, which with my teammate after discussing about it decided to keep. This was necessary because we wanted to use those frames with figma, so there needed to be some sort of storing and communication. An option was to allow the user to register theirself later on, however this could create frustration from the user if their main goal in that stage is to get their frames in Figma, and now they have to complete one more step: login in or signing up.

### Material Design: Guiding our way

At the end of the second week we got the feedback that it wasn't completely clear which device we were designing for. That's why with my teammate we decided to design for Android devices first and use the Material Design guidelines to improve our designs. We changed some buttons, added the right margins and spacing, and changed the font of the buttons. However some elements we decided to keep to give it more uniqueness.

## — FINAL UI

### What we presented and learnt

I learnt that reading and carefully applying the guidelines is of big help. However applying them blindly won't necessarily guarantee a good or intuitive design, since as the name said they are *guidelines* and at the end applying them wisely depends on the designers. I also realized that although working with design systems is of big help, sometimes when the changes need to be done quickly and involve more than changing the font or size of a group of objects, it might be easier to not always use them. Especially in this case where the communication was smooth and constant.

We delivered 19 screens plus the user flow at the end of the project.
